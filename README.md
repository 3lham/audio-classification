# audio-classification

This project, completed for the Machine Learning course, involved developing a speech-to-text application for digit recognition.  The application processes user audio input, transcribing spoken digits displayed between "START" and "STOP" commands.  Data collection and augmentation were performed using Audacity and Python, including melspectrogram conversion and augmentation techniques like masking, noise addition, and loudness adjustment. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on the augmented data, and a Python program was developed to capture audio input, extract relevant segments, and predict the spoken digits using the trained model. The project was implemented in Jupyter Notebook using Python 3.9.
